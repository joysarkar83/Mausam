The "Mausam" app provides weather information by fetching data from a weather API (OpenWeatherMap). It displays weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset. The app also uses animations (such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy) based on the weather condition. Users can search for cities to get real-time weather details, with the app offering a smooth, interactive UI. The app also adjusts backgrounds and animations according to the weather condition.
